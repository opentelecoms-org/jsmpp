Introduction

[![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/org.jsmpp/jsmpp/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/org.jsmpp/jsmpp)

jSMPP is a java implementation (SMPP API) of the SMPP protocol (currently supports
SMPP v3.3, v3.4 and v5.0). It provides interfaces to communicate with a Message Center
or an ESME (External Short Message Entity) and is able to handle
traffic of 3000-5000 messages per second. 

jSMPP is not a high-level library. People looking for a quick way to
get started with SMPP may be better of using an abstraction layer such
as the Apache Camel SMPP component [Apache Camel SMPP component](https://camel.apache.org/smpp.html)
